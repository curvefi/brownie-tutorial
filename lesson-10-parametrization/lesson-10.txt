As before -- same fonts and styles, intro and outro videos.  Text is below, along with other notes. 
Also prune some of the excess space around the active window

7:56 Pop up the red X with buzzer sound

Again we'll have green checkmarks, but this time we'll try something funky.
We'll in total have 10 checkmarks, so leave space on the screen
Checkmarks one through four will appear at:
8:33, 8:38, 8:43, 9:15  Pop up the green checkmark (noise at a level that doesn't overly drown out the speaker)
From 9:10 through 13:38 there is a lot of silence... speed it up to run on very fast motion
Fast as in a slapstick comedy pace (with music if it fits)
Pop up the remaining 6 checkmarks throughout.




0:08 During the break (After speaker says "PyTest's parametrization.") pop up a title card like video 7
Feel free to leave the title screen up for a couple of seconds longer.  
Just note that all the timestamps below are for the original video.
Title card text:
Lesson 10: Parametrized Testing


Delete from 0:42 to 0:44 -- when the screen intially changes there is some garbage that is cleared out by 0:44.  Make speaker transition as natural as possible
Also -- next timestamps still refer to original video, not the video after this deletion.

From the beginning through 7:42, blur out the "389343ffd..." sitting in the righthand pane.  
It reappears lower in the frame from 7:43 until 7:57.
It returns at 8:18 through the end of the video.
